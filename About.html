				<section id="history">
					<p><span class="sectionTitle">history</span><br><br>Lily attended Barnard College in Morningside Heights, earning her degree in Economics. After graduation, she prolonged graduate school, instead working a variety of internships and traveling. During this time, she developed her love of baking and a dream to open her own bakery. <br> <br> So, Lily went back to school, taking classes in marketing and business. A few years and lots of coins in the "Savings" jar, she finally opened the bakery in 2006. Since its opening, Lily's Bakery has been joined by Mark, who contributed a more formal background in bread-making as well as a French twist.</p>
